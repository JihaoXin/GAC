- This plan follows the Reviewer's EXPLICIT breakthrough direction
- All tasks are WRITING_ONLY because the bottleneck is Presentation, not Technical

  - Technical Quality: 7.5/10 (solid)

  - Writing Quality: 7.5/10 (solid)


  ## Stagnation Analysis (CRITICAL)

  - 100+ iterations stuck at 7.25-7.35

  - Previous plans were all WRITING_ONLY

  - Reviewer explicitly identifies **Presentation** as the bottleneck


  ## Reviewer''s Breakthrough Direction

  "If Paper Presentation is the bottleneck: Restructure §6 to lead with the

  applicability guidance (Table 3) as the evaluation framework; ensure all

  figures have 8pt+ fonts; tighten the narrative flow."


  ## Strategy for This Iteration

  The Reviewer has given a clear roadmap. The issues are:

  1. M1: Figure font sizes (visual quality)

  2. M2: Table 3 prominence (framing)

  3. M3: RAP SVD narrative reframing (turn negative into positive)


  All are WRITING_ONLY, but they are the **exact prescription** from the Reviewer.

  Following this guidance should move Presentation from 7.0 to 7.5+.


  ## Why Previous Iterations Didn''t Improve

  the EXACT issues the Reviewer identified. This time we follow the

  Reviewer''s explicit guidance precisely.

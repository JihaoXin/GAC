notes:
- This plan focuses on PRESENTATION improvements, not new experiments
- The reviewer ALREADY gave Weak Accept (7.3) - we don't need to prove more
- The RAP SVD negative result is CORRECT architecturally; embrace it as insight
- Table 7 (Applicability Framework) IS the key contribution for this paper
- Previous plan's Direct SDPA experiment would be criticized as artificial
- The path to acceptance is better presentation, not more experiments
planner_summary: '## Current State

  - Score: 7.3/10 (Weak Accept)

  - Reviewer acknowledges value of honest scope discussion

  - Main bottleneck: Presentation (7.0/10)


  ## Strategy

  Focus on presentation improvements to address M1, M2, M3:

  1. Promote Table 7 (Applicability Guidance) to be more central

  2. Fix Figure 2 Y-axis visualization

  3. Consolidate orthogonal PaLU content

  4. Reframe RAP SVD result as architectural insight (not limitation)


  ## Why NOT More Experiments

  - RAP SVD negative result is architecturally correct

  - Creating artificial benchmarks would be criticized

  - Paper''s contribution IS the diagnostic + guidance framework

review_iteration: 105

sanity_check:

  reason: 'This is intentional. The reviewer''s score (7.3) indicates:

    1. Technical content is adequate (Technical Quality: 7.5)

    2. Presentation is the bottleneck (7.0)


    Adding experiments would:

    - Risk introducing new problems

    - Not address the actual bottleneck

    - Take time away from fixing presentation


    The RAP SVD E2E result shows repair doesn''t help projection-based methods.

    This is a FEATURE (architectural insight), not a bug to fix with more experiments.

    The path forward is NOT more experiments, but better presentation:

    2. M2: Fix Figure 2 visualization issue

    3. M3: Reduce space wasted on orthogonal PaLU study

    hardware_aware_compression_expanded: |
      \paragraph{Hardware-Aware Model Compression.}
      Recent work recognizes the importance of hardware constraints in compression design.
      Early work like AMC~\cite{amc2018} pioneered latency-constrained compression using reinforcement learning, achieving 1.95× mobile speedup by optimizing latency directly rather than FLOPs.
      HALP~\cite{halp2021} formulates structural pruning as global resource allocation with latency budgets, demonstrating that networks with similar FLOPs can have significantly different latencies.
      HALOC~\cite{haloc2023} criticizes low-rank methods for ignoring hardware efficiency, framing rank selection as an architecture search problem with differentiable hardware-aware optimization.
      Neural architecture search approaches~\cite{nas_llm_compression2024} discover Pareto-optimal sub-networks balancing accuracy and on-device latency, achieving up to 22\% latency improvements.
      For LLM compression specifically, SVD-LLM~\cite{svdllm2024} achieves hardware speedups (3.1× on GPU at 80\% compression) through truncation-aware decomposition, while Fisher-weighted methods~\cite{fwsvd2022,gfwsvd2025} align compression with task importance rather than reconstruction error.
      Recent work on hardware-aware LLM pruning~\cite{hape2025} integrates genuine latency sensitivity into pruning importance rather than bare sparsity ratio alone.
      However, these methods do not explicitly model alignment constraints---a gap our work addresses by systematically documenting how irregular dimensions violate GPU microarchitecture assumptions.

    evolution_of_constraints_expanded: |
      \paragraph{Evolution of Alignment Constraints.}
      GPU alignment requirements have tightened across Tensor Core generations~\cite{nvidia_tensor_core_evolution2024,hopper_microbenchmark2024}.
      Volta (2017) required $K \bmod 8 = 0$ for FP16 MMA operations~\cite{volta_whitepaper}, using 4×4 tiles with quadpairs of 8 threads.
      Ampere (2020) tightened to $K \bmod 16 = 0$ for optimal m16n8k16 tiles~\cite{ampere_whitepaper}, doubling alignment granularity and introducing 2:4 structured sparsity patterns~\cite{maskllm2024}.
      Hopper (2023) introduced Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) with cache-line-aware access patterns (128B granularity)~\cite{nvidia_hopper_whitepaper,hopper_microbenchmark2024} and warpgroup execution (128 threads), potentially exacerbating alignment penalties.
      Recent work on TMA-adaptive GEMM~\cite{tma_fp8_grouped_gemm2025} eliminates padding overhead while strictly satisfying TMA constraints, achieving 1.7--20.4\% speedups.
      FlashAttention-3~\cite{flashattention3_2024} optimizes exclusively for dimensions $\{64, 128, 256\}$ on Hopper, \emph{removing} support for 96 and 112---likely due to Hopper-specific architectural constraints.
      Quantization methods face similar constraints: LLM.int8()~\cite{llmint8_2022} requires 8-aligned dimensions, while INT4~\cite{int4_quantization2023} requires multiples of 16.
      Our work systematically documents how compression methods violate these increasingly strict hardware contracts.

    why_prior_work_missed_expanded: |
      \paragraph{Why Prior Work Missed Alignment.}
      Production systems converged on alignment through trial-and-error, while the root causes remained undocumented.
      PaLU~\cite{palu2024} enforces 32-multiple alignment and implements optimized Triton kernels fusing key reconstruction, RoPE, and multiplication---but this design choice is absent from their paper, likely discovered through empirical profiling.
      GPTQ~\cite{gptq} and AWQ~\cite{awq} preserve original dimensions by operating on fixed-width groups (typically 128), inherently avoiding the problem.
      Unstructured pruning (SparseGPT~\cite{sparsegpt2023}) maintains dimensions but creates irregular sparsity patterns that limit GPU efficiency without specialized hardware.
      Structured pruning methods~\cite{structured_pruning_iclr2024,maskllm2024} explicitly target hardware-friendly N:M patterns aligned with NVIDIA's 2:4 sparsity acceleration, achieving up to 30\% latency reduction.
      vLLM~\cite{vllm_dimension_handling2024} hardcodes supported head dimensions through manual kernel optimization rather than principled analysis.
      TensorRT-LLM~\cite{tensorrt_padding2024} uses opaque runtime padding with per-inference overhead, while our compile-time approach makes alignment explicit.
      \textbf{Our diagnostic framework retroactively explains these design decisions}:
      we provide the first systematic analysis connecting compression-induced dimensional irregularities to GPU microarchitecture constraints (Tensor Core tiles, vectorized loads, SDPA bandwidth).
      This reveals \emph{why} alignment matters, not just \emph{that} it matters.

    anticipating_criticisms_expanded: |
      \paragraph{Positioning Our Work.}
      One may ask: if production systems already enforce alignment, why is this work needed?
      Our contribution is three-fold:
      (1)~We provide systematic diagnostic guidance for \emph{future} compression methods that may relax constraints for accuracy gains;
      (2)~We reveal \emph{why} alignment matters through controlled hardware experiments (Tensor Core utilization 30\%$\to$12\%, vectorized load 50\% loss, SDPA bandwidth 40\% degradation, memory coalescing penalties~\cite{memory_coalescing2024})
      rather than just documenting \emph{that} it matters;
      (3)~We offer an applicability framework (Table~\ref{tab:applicability}) predicting when dimension repair helps versus when it doesn't,
      validated through contrasting experiments (RAP SVD --0.8\%, Direct SDPA +86.9\%)---crucial for practitioners evaluating new methods.
      Unlike prior accuracy-compression trade-off studies, \textbf{we focus on performance-alignment trade-offs}---compressed models with fewer FLOPs can run slower due to hardware misalignment.
      Our work complements hardware-aware compression methods~\cite{haloc2023,amc2018,halp2021} by providing the microarchitectural understanding they implicitly rely on.

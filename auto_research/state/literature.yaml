    §7.3 Evolution of Alignment Constraints (4-5 句)
    §7.4 Why Prior Work Missed Alignment (5-6 句)
    §7.5 Positioning Our Work (2-3 句)

  paragraph_drafts:

    evolution_of_constraints: |
      \paragraph{Evolution of Alignment Constraints.}
      GPU alignment requirements have tightened across Tensor Core generations~\cite{nvidia_tensor_core_evolution2024,hopper_microbenchmark2024}.
      Volta (2017) required $K \bmod 8 = 0$ for FP16 MMA operations~\cite{volta_whitepaper}.
      Ampere (2020) tightened to $K \bmod 16 = 0$ for optimal m16n8k16 tiles~\cite{ampere_whitepaper}, introducing greater sensitivity to dimensional irregularities.
      Hopper (2023) introduced Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) with cache-line-aware access patterns~\cite{nvidia_hopper_whitepaper,hopper_microbenchmark2024}, potentially exacerbating alignment penalties.
      FlashAttention-3~\cite{flashattention3_2024} optimizes exclusively for dimensions $\{64, 128, 256\}$ on Hopper, removing support for 96 and 112---likely due to Hopper-specific architectural constraints.
      Our work systematically documents how compression methods violate these increasingly strict hardware contracts.

    hardware_aware_compression: |
      \paragraph{Hardware-Aware Model Compression.}
      Recent work recognizes the importance of hardware constraints in compression design.
      HALOC~\cite{haloc2023} criticizes low-rank methods for ignoring hardware efficiency, framing rank selection as an architecture search problem with differentiable hardware-aware optimization.
      Neural architecture search approaches~\cite{nas_llm_compression2024} discover Pareto-optimal sub-networks balancing accuracy and on-device latency, achieving up to 22\% latency improvements.
      SVD-LLM~\cite{svdllm2024} achieves hardware speedups (3.1× on GPU at 80\% compression) through truncation-aware decomposition but does not explicitly model alignment constraints.
      Low-rank decomposition offers hardware-agnostic compression through dense matrix operations~\cite{svdllm2024}, but the resulting irregular dimensions can violate GPU microarchitecture assumptions---a gap our work addresses.

    why_prior_work_missed: |
      \paragraph{Why Prior Work Missed Alignment.}
      Production systems converged on alignment through trial-and-error, while the root causes remained undocumented.
      PaLU~\cite{palu2024} enforces 32-multiple alignment but this design choice is absent from their paper---likely discovered through empirical profiling.
      GPTQ~\cite{gptq} and AWQ~\cite{awq} preserve original dimensions by operating on fixed-width groups (typically 128), inherently avoiding the problem.
      Unstructured pruning (SparseGPT~\cite{sparsegpt2023}) maintains dimensions but creates irregular sparsity patterns that limit GPU efficiency.
      vLLM~\cite{vllm_dimension_handling2024} hardcodes supported head dimensions through manual kernel optimization rather than principled analysis.
      \textbf{Our diagnostic framework retroactively explains these design decisions}:
      we provide the first systematic analysis connecting compression-induced dimensional irregularities to GPU microarchitecture constraints (Tensor Core tiles, vectorized loads, SDPA bandwidth).
      This reveals \emph{why} alignment matters, not just \emph{that} it matters.

    anticipating_criticisms: |
      \paragraph{Positioning Our Work.}
      One may ask: if production systems already enforce alignment, why is this work needed?
      Our contribution is three-fold:
      (1)~We provide systematic diagnostic guidance for \emph{future} compression methods that may relax constraints for accuracy gains;
      (2)~We reveal \emph{why} alignment matters through controlled hardware experiments (Tensor Core utilization 30\%$\to$12\%, vectorized load 50\% loss, SDPA bandwidth 40\% degradation)
      rather than just documenting \emph{that} it matters;
      (3)~We offer an applicability framework (Table~\ref{tab:applicability}) predicting when dimension repair helps versus when it doesn't,
      validated through contrasting experiments (RAP SVD --0.8\%, Direct SDPA +86.9\%)---crucial for practitioners evaluating new methods.
      Unlike prior accuracy-compression trade-off studies, \textbf{we focus on performance-alignment trade-offs}---compressed models with fewer FLOPs can run slower due to hardware misalignment.

# ===== WRITING SUGGESTIONS FOR H100 GENERALIZATION EXPANSION =====

h100_discussion_expansion:

  current_text: |
    \paragraph{H100 Generalization.}
    Our experiments focus on A100; H100 validation is future work.
    Architectural similarities suggest dimensional collapse likely persists: H100's 4th-gen Tensor Cores use m16n8k16 MMA tiles requiring $K \mod 16 = 0$~\cite{nvidia_hopper_whitepaper}, and FlashAttention-3 still optimizes for specific dimensions $\{64, 128, 256\}$~\cite{flashattention3}.
    Empirical validation is planned future work.

  proposed_expanded_text: |
    \paragraph{H100 Generalization and Cross-GPU Portability.}
    Our experiments focus on A100 GPUs; empirical H100 validation is future work due to hardware availability constraints.
    However, architectural analysis suggests dimensional collapse likely persists or intensifies on H100 for three reasons:

    \textbf{(1) Persistent alignment constraints}:
    H100's 4th-generation Tensor Cores maintain the same m16n8k16 MMA tile structure as Ampere~\cite{nvidia_hopper_whitepaper}, requiring $K \bmod 16 = 0$ for optimal throughput.
    Recent microbenchmarking~\cite{hopper_microbenchmark2024} confirms alignment sensitivity persists despite 2× higher per-SM MMA rates and 50\% increased memory bandwidth (3 TB/s HBM3 vs 2 TB/s HBM2e).

    \textbf{(2) Stricter memory access patterns}:
    H100 introduces Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) with cache-line-aware block transfers~\cite{nvidia_hopper_whitepaper,hopper_microbenchmark2024}, potentially exacerbating penalties from irregular dimensions that violate 128-byte cache-line boundaries.
    Warpgroup execution (128 threads vs 32-thread warps) increases MMA scheduling granularity, making dimension alignment more critical.

    \textbf{(3) Software-level constraints tightening}:
    FlashAttention-3~\cite{flashattention3_2024} removes support for head dimensions 96 and 112 on Hopper, restricting to $\{64, 128, 256\}$ only---suggesting Hopper-specific architectural constraints make these previously-supported dimensions inefficient.
    The library achieves 75\% of H100's theoretical peak (740 TFLOPs/s) only for these specific dimensions, compared to FlashAttention-2's 35\% utilization when not using Hopper-specific instructions.

    \paragraph{Broader Cross-Hardware Implications.}
    Hardware-aware compression faces fundamental portability challenges~\cite{llm_inference_hardware_survey2024}.
    LLM inference performance varies 18--343 tok/s for 7B models across GPU platforms, reflecting architectural heterogeneity.
    Large-scale deployments require hardware-specific co-design~\cite{fire_flyer_ai_hpc2024}, as optimization strategies for A100 PCIe vs H100 SXM differ fundamentally.
    TensorRT-LLM's 4.6× H100 speedup over A100~\cite{h100_vs_a100_tensorrt2024} requires architecture-specific kernel tuning, not automatic portability.

    Our diagnostic framework (Table~\ref{tab:root_causes}) generalizes by targeting \emph{microarchitectural invariants}---Tensor Core tile alignment, vectorized memory accesses, and SDPA dimension constraints---rather than A100-specific implementation details.
    While absolute performance numbers will differ, the \emph{relative penalties} from misalignment should persist across Ampere, Hopper, and future architectures that maintain similar Tensor Core tile structures (m16n8k16 family).
    Future work should validate this hypothesis empirically on H100 and characterize how TMA's cache-line-aware transfers interact with irregular dimensions.
